		<p>From mythology to folklore and fables, mythical creatures have been a critical part of antient stories, 
		before we were able to write them down. With the invention of the paper printer and the silver screen these, 
		whimsy beasts, have spread both in popularity and culturally. Slightly changing in every rendition, 
		thereâ€™re in. They have captured the hearts of many and only live in our cleated imagination, 
		brought forth by our story telling.
		</p>
		
		<p>Creatures have been told in many different ways and with many different intentions. 
		From the angelic European Unicorn to the cannibalistic wendigo of the Native American. 
		These, magical beasts have been used to teach lessons, to elevate or aid heroes on their nobel quest. 
		Ferocious monsters that need to be concord. Curses we must evade. Whimsical creatures aiding and healing us. 
		With mischievous tricksters, just wonting to have fun. Mythical beasts have been a part of many stories, 
		with many renditions, and many more to come. Giving us more and more mythical beasts to explore.
